  <strong> ABOUT!!</strong>
I decided to solve a problem for owner of playschools and other kid's school.
I got this idea as my brother has just opened a kid's playschool"The Great Master".
He will be using this website in order to maintain the student record and also to keep the track of those students how's parents inquired.

 <strong>USER STORIES</strong><br>

<strong>IMPLEMENTED :</strong><br>
1. Sign-up, Sign-in, Change-password, Sign-out for teacher & Admin<br>
2. Teacher and Admin can do CRUD Operation on student<br>
3. Teacher and Admin can View and Delete the Request send by website Visitor<br>

<strong>Architecture:</strong><br>

On the front end I used browser to display the pages and make call to my API.<br>
I used posgress postgres to Rails to create the API. While planning, I gathered<br>
the requirement from my brother and then designed the Wireframe which made it easier<br>
how to build both parts.

 <strong>Technologies/Dependencies used:</strong>
 Handlebars, Bootstrap, postgressql<br>
 I installed npm by 'npminstall'<br>

<strong>HURDLES:</strong>
Handlebars created the problem for the update action I was not able to get the right
student.id to do update action on.

<strong>Thank you!</strong>
