  ABOUT!!
I decided to solve a problem for owner of playschools and other kid's school.
I got this idea as my brother has just opened a kid's playschool"The Great Master".
He will be using this website in order to maintain the student record and also to keep the track of those students how's parents inquired.

IMAGE OF PROJECT

USER STORIES

IMPLEMENTED :-
1. Sign-up, Sign-in, Change-password, Sign-out for teacher & Admin
2. Teacher and Admin can do CRUD Operation on student
3. Teacher and Admin can View and Delete the Request send by website Visitor

Architecture:

On the front end I used browser to display the pages and make call to my API.
I used posgress postgres to Rails to create the API. While planning, I gathered
the requirement from my brother and then designed the Wireframe which made it easier
how to build both parts.

 Technologies/Dependencies used:-
 Handlebars, Bootstrap, postgressql
 I installed npm by 'npminstall'

HURDLES:
Handlebars created the problem for the update action I was not able to get the right
student.id to do update action on.

Thank you!
